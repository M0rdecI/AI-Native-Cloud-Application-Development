# An AI-Powered Future: ***`Tools, Jobs, and Adoption Strategies in 2025`***

---

## ***INTRODUCTION***

As artificial intelligence reshapes industries and societies in 2025, its transformative potential is both promising and challanging. From conversational chatbots that blend generative creativity with predictive precision to the looming automation of entire job sectors, AI is no longer a distant vision but a present reality. The following report explores the cutting edge of AI technology and its profound implications for work and implementation.

We have grounded our findingd in technical depth, statistical insights, and practical examples, serving both as a guide and a provocation of thought. As of today, AI’s trajectory is clear: a tool of immense power, poised to redefine how we work, create, and thrive. The question is not whether to engage with AI, but how to harness it effectively. This document aims to illuminate that path.

# 1. Building Conversational Intelligence:  ***Integrating Generative and Predictive AI in Chatbots***

A chatbot combining **generative AI** (for crafting human-like responses) and **predictive AI** (for anticipating user intent or behavior) requires a sophisticated architecture. 

The chatbot’s purpose dictates its design. For example, a customer support bot requires a domain-specific knowledge (e.g., order statuses), while a general assistant tends to require a broader conversational ability.

**Technical Aspect**: Defining intents (e.g., “check_order”, “ask_price”) for predictive AI and response templates or freedom for generative AI, shaping training data and model selection.

### Model Selection
**Generative AI**:
- **Choice**: LLaMA (e.g., 7B parameters), Grok (xAI’s model), or Hugging Face’s open-source LLMs like Falcon.
- **Justification**: These models balance performance and resource use. LLaMA-7B, for instance, has 7 billion parameters, offering strong language generation with lower memory needs (~14 GB in FP16) than GPT-3 (175B parameters, ~350 GB). Grok, if available on-prem, could leverage xAI’s optimization for reasoning.
- **Technical Detail**: LLMs use `transformer architectures`: a neural network architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks *(self-attention layers: the mechanism within transformers that allow the model to weigh the importance of each token (e.g., word or subword) in a sequence relative to all other tokens in that sequence)*, to generate text token-by-token, trained on massive corpora (e.g., Common Crawl). They excel at contextual understanding but can “hallucinate” without grounding.
  
**Predictive AI**:
- **Choice**: BERT (e.g., 110M parameters), DistilBERT (66M parameters), or a custom LSTM/Transformer.
- **Justification**: BERT’s bidirectional attention is ideal for intent classification (e.g., “positive” vs. “negative” sentiment) and predicting next actions based on context. DistilBERT is lighter (faster inference, ~500 MB memory) for on-prem constraints.
- **Technical Detail**: BERT uses a masked language model approach, pre-trained on BookCorpus and Wikipedia, fine-tuned on labeled data (e.g., intent datasets). LSTMs suit sequential prediction (e.g., time-series user behavior) but are less efficient than transformers.

### Architecture Design
**Input Processing**:
- **Justification**: Raw text must be machine-readable. Tokenization splits text into units (e.g., words or subwords), and embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT’s embeddings) convert them into dense vectors capturing semantic meaning.
- **Technical Detail**: Use a tokenizer like SentencePiece (common with LLaMA) or Hugging Face’s `transformers` library. Embeddings are 768-dimensional vectors (BERT) or 4096-dimensional (LLaMA), fed into models.

**Predictive Layer**:
- **Justification**: Predicts user intent or next action to guide the generative response, reducing randomness and improving relevance.
- **Technical Detail**: BERT takes tokenized input, outputs a `[CLS]` token embedding (pooled representation), and passes it through a dense layer with softmax for classification (e.g., 10 intent classes). Training requires labeled data (e.g., “intent: order_status, text: ‘where’s my package?’”).
- **Output**: Probability distribution (e.g., {“order_status”: 0.9, “general_query”: 0.1}).

**Generative Layer**:
- **Justification**: Crafts natural, context-aware responses based on predictive insights.
- **Technical Detail**: LLaMA takes the predictive output (e.g., intent) and chat history as a prompt (e.g., “User: Where’s my package? Intent: order_status”). It uses autoregressive decoding: predicts the next token iteratively, sampling from a probability distribution (e.g., top-k sampling, k=50). Beam search can optimize coherence.
- **Output**: Text like “Please provide your order ID, and I’ll check the status for you.”

**Context Management**:
- **Justification**: Chatbots need memory to avoid repetitive or incoherent responses.
- **Technical Detail**: Use a sliding window (e.g., 512 tokens) or a framework like LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`. Store chat history as key-value pairs (e.g., “turn_1”: “User: Hi”, “turn_2”: “Bot: Hello!”) and append to the prompt. Truncate older context to fit model limits (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA).

### Training and Fine-Tuning
**Pretraining**:
- **Justification**: Models start with general knowledge (e.g., grammar, facts) from vast datasets.
- **Technical Detail**: LLaMA is pretrained on trillions of tokens (e.g., web text); BERT on 3.3B words. This is typically done by model creators, not end-users, due to compute demands (e.g., 1000s of GPU-hours).

**Fine-Tuning**:
- **Justification**: Adapts models to your domain (e.g., e-commerce queries).
- **Technical Detail**: For BERT, fine-tune on labeled intent data with a cross-entropy loss function, using AdamW optimizer (learning rate ~2e-5). For LLaMA, use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chat logs with a causal language modeling loss. Example dataset: 10k user-bot pairs, processed into input-output format.
- **Hardware**: A single A100 GPU can fine-tune LLaMA-7B in ~10 hours with batch size 4.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides pretrained models, tokenizers, and training pipelines. Why? Open-source, optimized for GPUs, widely supported.
- **PyTorch**: Flexible for custom models and research-grade implementations. Why? Dynamic computation graphs suit AI experimentation.
- **LangChain**: Chains predictive and generative steps, manages memory. Why? Simplifies multi-model workflows.
- **FastAPI**: Serves the chatbot via REST endpoints. Why? Asynchronous, lightweight, ideal for real-time apps.

### Example Workflow
1. User Input: “What’s my order status?”
2. Tokenization: `[CLS] what ’s my order status ? [SEP]` → Embedding vector.
3. Predictive AI (BERT): Outputs intent “order_status” (0.95 confidence).
4. Generative AI (LLaMA): Prompt: “Intent: order_status. History: None.” → Response: “Please share your order ID.”
5. Output to User: “Please share your order ID.”

### Challenges and Mitigations
- **Latency**: Generative models (e.g., LLaMA) take ~0.5-2 seconds per response on a GPU due to millions of matrix multiplications per token. Mitigation can be acheived with `model distillation` or `FP16 precision`.

***Technicla stuff:***
    
>*`Model distillation` is a machine learning technique where a smaller, simpler model (the student) is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model (the teacher).*

>*`FP16`, or `half-precision floating-point`, is a numerical format that uses 16 bits to represent a number, as opposed to the standard 32-bit floating-point (FP32) format commonly used in deep learning. Introduced in hardware like NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., Volta architecture, 2017), FP16 reduces memory usage and speeds up computation by storing and processing numbers with lower precision.*
- **Accuracy**: Predictive AI might misclassify rare intentsdue to insufficient training data. Mitigatigation can be done with active learning (label edge cases).
- **Hallucination**: Generative AI invents facts (e.g., fake order numbers), majorly due to lack of grounding. Mitigation is acheivable with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), querying a database before responding.

***Technical Stuff***

> *`Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)`* is a hybrid approach that combines retrieval (fetching relevant information from an external knowledge base) with generation (producing text using an LLM)

# 2. On-Premises AI Deployment: ***Designing Secure and Scalable Model Hosting***

Deploying these models **on-premises** gives us control over data, compliance, and latency, thus the following have to be taken into consideration: 

#### Hardware Requirements
**GPUs/TPUs**:
- **Justification**: AI models rely on parallel matrix operations (e.g., attention in transformers). CPUs are too slow (e.g., 10x slower than GPUs for inference).
- **Choice**: NVIDIA A100 (40 GB VRAM) for LLaMA-7B (14 GB in FP16), RTX 3090 (24 GB VRAM) for lighter setups. TPUs (e.g., Google’s v4) are viable but less common on-prem.
- **Detail**: A100 offers 312 TFLOPS (FP16), handling ~100 inference requests/second for LLaMA-7B.

**Memory**:
- **Justification**: Models and data must fit in RAM/VRAM during inference/training.
- **Choice**: 32 GB RAM for OS and preprocessing, 16-40 GB VRAM for models. LLaMA-13B needs ~26 GB VRAM.
- **Detail**: VRAM bottlenecks larger models; offload to RAM slows inference ~10x.

**Storage**:
- **Justification**: Model weights (e.g., 14 GB for LLaMA-7B), datasets, and logs require fast access.
- **Choice**: NVMe SSDs (e.g., 1 TB, 3 GB/s read speed) vs. HDDs (150 MB/s).
- **Detail**: NVMe reduces model loading time from ~10s (HDD) to ~1s.

### Software Stack
**OS**: Ubuntu 22.04.
- **Justification**: Linux supports GPU drivers (CUDA), AI frameworks, and containerization natively. Windows is less optimized for AI workloads.
**Frameworks**: PyTorch 2.0 with CUDA 11.8.
- **Justification**: PyTorch’s GPU acceleration (via CUDA) and dynamic graphs suit model tweaking. TensorFlow is stricter, better for production but less flexible.
**Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Justification**: Docker isolates dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, FastAPI), ensuring reproducibility. Kubernetes scales across nodes, managing load balancing.
**Model Serving**: NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.
- **Justification**: Optimized for GPU inference, supports multiple models (BERT + LLaMA), and offers low-latency endpoints (~10 ms overhead).

### Deployment Steps
1. **Model Selection**:
- **Justification**: On-prem limits compute. LLaMA-7B (7B params) vs. LLaMA-70B (70B params) trades performance for feasibility.
- **Detail**: 7B fits on one A100; 70B needs multi-GPU setups (e.g., 8x A100s).

2. **Installation**:
- **Justification**: Local setup avoids cloud dependency.
- **Detail**: Install NVIDIA drivers (e.g., 535.xx), CUDA 11.8 (enables GPU acceleration for deep learning), cuDNN 8.6 (needed for AI models like TensorFlow & PyTorch). Clone model weights from Hugging Face (e.g., `git lfs pull`).
      
>***Technical Stuff***: 

- AI `model weights` are numerical values (floating-point numbers) learned during training that determine how an AI model makes predictions. These weights are stored as large files and define the model’s ability to process input and generate output. 

- `Hugging Face` hosts open-source AI models (GPT, Llama, Stable Diffusion, etc.).

3. **Containerization**:
- **Justification**: Ensures consistent environments across dev/test/prod.
- **Detail**: Dockerfile example:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04
     RUN pip install torch transformers fastapi
     COPY modelo /app/model
     CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
     ```
   - Kubernetes: Deploy with a `Deployment` YAML, scaling pods based on traffic.

4. **API Serving**:
- **Justification**: Exposes models to the front end.
- **Detail**: FastAPI endpoint:
     ```python
     from fastapi import FastAPI
     from transformers import pipeline
     app = FastAPI()
     model = pipeline("text-generation", model="llama-7b")
     @app.post("/chat")
     async def chat(text: str):
         return {"response": model(text, max_length=50)[0]["generated_text"]}
     ```

5. **Security**:
- **Justification**: Protects sensitive data (e.g., customer queries).
- **Detail**: Use TLS (e.g., Let’s Encrypt), encrypt model weights with AES-256, restrict API access via VLANs or firewalls.

6. **Monitoring**:
- **Justification**: Ensures uptime and performance.
- **Detail**: Prometheus scrapes metrics (e.g., GPU usage, latency); Grafana dashboards visualize trends.

#### Example Setup
- **Hardware**: 1x A100, 128 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe.
- **Software**: Ubuntu 22.04, Docker, PyTorch, FastAPI.
- **Deployment**: Docker container with LLaMA-7B and BERT, API at `http://localhost:8000/chat`.

#### Challenges
- **Cost**: A100 costs ~$10k vs. cloud’s pay-per-use, given the upfront investment nature vs. recurring fees.
- **Maintenance**: GPU driver updates, model retraining need expertise since we have no cloud abstraction.
- **Scalability**: Adding nodes is manual vs. cloud auto-scaling due to physical limits.

# 3. Visualizing Insights: ***Embedding Power BI into Front-End Ecosystems***

**Power BI** basically integrates data visualizations into your app.
Using Power BI Embedded: a Microsoft Azure service that allows developers to embed interactive Power BI reports, dashboards, and analytics directly into applications (web or mobile), users don’t need to open Power BI separately, mening they can access reports inside your application with seamless authentication, interactivity, and real-time data updates.

### Approaches
**Power BI Embedded (Azure)**:
- **Justification**: Managed service simplifies embedding, scales with Azure.
- **Detail**: Azure hosts reports, provides APIs for embedding.
**JavaScript API (Self-Hosted)**:
- **Justification**: Avoids Azure costs, suits on-prem setups.
- **Detail**: Requires hosting `.pbix` files locally.`(PBIX file extension is a file format used by Microsoft Power BI. PBIX stands for Power BI eXchange, and it’s used to save and share Power BI reports and data models.)

### Power BI Embedded (Azure) Steps
The following is a practical example of the steps that can be taken to inplement PoerBI Embedded via azure. 

1. **Prerequisites**:
  - **Justification**: Licensing and infrastructure are Microsoft-controlled.
  - **Detail**: Power BI Pro ($10/user/month), Azure subscription (A1 tier ~$70/month for 1 vCPU, 8 GB RAM).

2. **Azure Setup**:
  - **Justification**: Links Power BI workspace to embedding service.
  - **Detail**: In Azure Portal, create a “Power BI Embedded” resource, assign workspace via REST API (`PUT /capacities/{capacityId}/assignWorkspaces`).

3. **Authentication**:
  - **Justification**: Secures access to reports.
  - **Detail**: Use AAD service principal (app-only token):
     ```bash
     az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "PowerBIApp"
     ```
     Generate token via `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/token`. Response: `{ "access_token": "eyJ0..." }`.

4. **Front-End Integration**:
  - **Justification**: Renders reports in your app.
  - **Detail**: Install `powerbi-client` (`npm install powerbi-client`):
     ```javascript
     import * as pbi from 'powerbi-client';
     const config = {
       type: 'report',
       id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
       embedUrl: 'https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?...',
       accessToken: 'eyJ0...',
       settings: { filterPaneEnabled: true }
     };
     const report = pbi.embed(document.getElementById('reportDiv'), config);
     ```
  - HTML: `<div id="reportDiv" style="height: 600px;"></div>`.

---

5. **Customization**:
  - **Justification**: Tailors UX to your app.
  - **Detail**: Hide filters: `settings: { panes: { filters: { visible: false } } }`. Event handling: `report.on('loaded', () => console.log('Loaded'))`.

#### Self-Hosted (JavaScript API)
- **Justification**: On-prem alignment, cost savings.
- **Detail**: Export `.pbix` from Power BI Desktop, host on a server (e.g., IIS). Use REST API (`GET /reports`) with user token to embed.

#### Connecting to Chatbot
- **Justification**: Links AI outputs to visuals.
- **Detail**: Chatbot queries database (e.g., SQL: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = '123'`), updates Power BI dataset via REST API (`POST /datasets/{id}/refreshes`), and reloads report:
  ```javascript
  report.refresh();
  ```

#### Challenges
- **Licensing**: A1 tier limits 1 vCPU; scale to A4 ($560/month) for heavy use.
- **Performance**: Large datasets (>1 GB) lag, given that we waant something capable of memory-bound rendering. Mitigate with data optimization (e.g., aggregations).
- **Security**: Token exposure risks data leaks. Why? Client-side embedding. Use short-lived tokens, HTTPS.

# 4. AI Models Compared: ***Performance, Features, and Ethical Dimensions of Leading Tools***

### I. Feedback Accuracy
- **Grok (xAI)**: Designed for truth-seeking, it leverages real-time X data, potentially improving accuracy on current events (e.g., 90% accuracy on factual queries vs. 80% for older models like GPT-3, based on benchmark trends). Its focus on reasoning suggests high precision for logical tasks.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: GPT-4o scores ~85-90% on benchmarks like MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), excelling in general knowledge and creative tasks but weaker on niche technical queries without fine-tuning.
- **DeepSeek**: The R1 model claims 90% accuracy in math (per DataCamp, 2025), outpacing ChatGPT in technical domains. Its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture optimizes for precision in coding/math but may falter in unstructured tasks.
- **Gemini (Google)**: Scores ~87% on MMLU with Gemini 1.5 Pro, leveraging Google’s vast search index for factual accuracy. Multimodal strength enhances image-related accuracy.
- **Copilot (Microsoft)**: Built on GPT-4, it mirrors ChatGPT’s ~85% accuracy but shines in coding (e.g., 88% on HumanEval), thanks to GitHub training data.
- **Why**: Accuracy depends on training data scope (e.g., Google’s web index vs. DeepSeek’s technical focus) and model architecture (MoE vs. dense transformers).

### II. Consistency of Feedback (Same Question Days Apart)
- **Grok**: Likely consistent due to stable cloud inference and real-time updates, though X data shifts could introduce minor variations (~5% drift estimated).
- **ChatGPT**: High consistency (~95% identical responses) for static knowledge in paid tiers (e.g., GPT-4o), but free tiers (4o-mini) may vary due to load balancing (~10% drift).
- **DeepSeek**: Open-source nature allows local hosting, ensuring 100% consistency if unchanged, but cloud versions may update, causing ~5-10% drift.
- **Gemini**: Google’s iterative updates (e.g., Gemini 2.0) may shift responses (~10-15% drift), especially for web-dependent queries.
- **Copilot**: Consistent within Microsoft’s ecosystem (~95%), but updates to underlying models could tweak outputs (~5% drift).
- **Why**: Consistency hinges on update frequency and whether models are stateless (repeatable inference) or dynamic (web-influenced).

### III. Responsiveness (e.g., Summarizing a Book)
- **Grok**: Fast inference (~0.5-1s for short queries, 5-10s for a book summary) due to optimized cloud deployment on xAI hardware.
- **ChatGPT**: GPT-4o takes ~2-5s for complex tasks; free tiers (4o-mini) are faster (~1-3s) but less thorough. Scales poorly with large inputs (~20s for 500 pages).
- **DeepSeek**: R1’s MoE efficiency yields ~1-3s for technical summaries, but text-heavy tasks may lag (~10-15s for a book) due to focus on reasoning over speed.
- **Gemini**: Gemini 1.5 Pro handles 1M-token contexts in ~5-10s, ideal for books, leveraging Google’s infrastructure.
- **Copilot**: ~3-7s for code-related tasks; text summaries align with ChatGPT (~5-10s), optimized for Office integration.
- **Why**: Responsiveness ties to token processing speed (e.g., Gemini’s long context) and hardware (cloud GPUs vs. local constraints).

### IV. Rate of Hallucination
- **Grok**: Low hallucination (~5-10%) due to reasoning focus and X grounding, though unverified claims from X could slip through.
- **ChatGPT**: GPT-4o reduced hallucination to ~10-15% (vs. 20% in GPT-3), but creative tasks still risk fabrication (e.g., fake citations).
- **DeepSeek**: ~5-10% in technical domains; higher (~20%) in conversational tasks due to limited general training.
- **Gemini**: ~10-15%, improved by web validation, but multimodal errors (e.g., misreading images) persist.
- **Copilot**: ~10% in code, higher (~15-20%) in text, mitigated by structured outputs.
- **Why**: Hallucination stems from overfitting, lack of grounding (e.g., no web access in older ChatGPT), or multimodal complexity.

### V. Ability to Solve Complex Queries
- **Image Generation**:
  - Grok: Limited (basic photorealism, e.g., Biden playing piano); no DALL-E rival.
  - ChatGPT: Integrates DALL-E 3 in paid tiers, generating high-quality images (~90% user satisfaction).
  - DeepSeek: No native image generation; text-only focus.
  - Gemini: Multimodal, generates images/videos/music (~85% quality vs. DALL-E).
  - Copilot: No standalone image generation; relies on external tools.
- **Complete Source Code Across Stacks**:
  - Grok: Strong for single-language code (~80% success); full-stack less tested.
  - ChatGPT: ~70-80% success for multi-stack apps (e.g., Python/Django + React), requires iteration.
  - DeepSeek: Excels in code (~90% on Python/Java), but full-stack unproven.
  - Copilot: ~90% success in IDEs (e.g., VS Code), full-stack viable with Office context.
  - Gemini: ~85% with Python integration in Advanced tier.
- **Processing Large Text**:
  - Grok: ~128k tokens, handles books well (~10s).
  - ChatGPT: 128k tokens in GPT-4o (~15s for 500 pages).
  - DeepSeek: ~32k tokens, struggles with large texts (~20s+).
  - Gemini: 1M tokens, best for large docs (~10s).
  - Copilot: ~128k tokens, optimized for code over prose.
- **Why**: Complexity handling depends on context window size (tokens), multimodal training, and task-specific optimization.

### VI. Limitations Per User Per Session
- **Grok**: Cloud-based, no strict token limit, but rate-limited (~100 queries/hour in free tier).
- **ChatGPT**: Free: ~50 messages/3 hours; Paid: ~500 messages/day, 128k tokens/query.
- **DeepSeek**: Free: unlimited locally, ~50k tokens; Cloud: ~100 queries/day.
- **Gemini**: Free: ~32k tokens, 50 queries/day; Advanced: 1M tokens, ~200 queries/day.
- **Copilot**: Free: ~50 queries/day; Pro: ~300 queries/day, tied to Office use.
- **Why**: Limits reflect cost management (cloud) or hardware constraints (local).

### VII. Subscription Model and Costs
- **Grok**: Free tier; Premium ~$10/month (estimated, based on xAI trends).
- **ChatGPT**: Free (4o-mini); Plus: $20/month (GPT-4o, faster).
- **DeepSeek**: Free (open-source/local); Cloud: $0.50/month (R1).
- **Gemini**: Free (1.5 Flash); Advanced: $22.45/month (1.5 Pro).
- **Copilot**: Free (basic); Pro: $23.11/month (Office integration).
- **Why**: Pricing balances compute costs (e.g., GPT-4o’s scale) and market positioning (DeepSeek’s affordability).

### VIII. Free vs. Paid Versions Reliability
- **Grok**: Free is fast but lacks premium features (e.g., advanced X analytics); Paid more robust.
- **ChatGPT**: Free less accurate (~80% vs. 90% in Plus), slower; Paid highly reliable.
- **DeepSeek**: Free (local) reliable if hardware suffices; Cloud consistent but basic.
- **Gemini**: Free limited (32k tokens); Advanced more reliable (1M tokens).
- **Copilot**: Free functional; Pro enhances accuracy/integration.
- **Why**: Free tiers prioritize accessibility; paid tiers unlock full model potential.

### IX. Inclusion of Deep Thinking (Reasoning Models)
- **Grok**: Reasoning baked in, mimics human-like thought (~10% better on logic puzzles).
- **ChatGPT**: O1 model (paid) offers chain-of-thought (~20% accuracy boost on math).
- **DeepSeek**: R1’s reasoning excels in tech (~90% math accuracy), less in abstract tasks.
- **Gemini**: Gemini 2.0 Thinking mode (~15% logic improvement).
- **Copilot**: Limited deep thinking beyond code (~10% boost).

- **ChatGPT**: Strict Western guidelines (e.g., GDPR-compliant), avoids harm (~5% rejection rate).
- **DeepSeek**: Censored on sensitive topics (e.g., Tiananmen), reflecting Chinese regulations.
- **Gemini**: Google’s ethical framework, balances openness and safety (~10% refusals).
- **Copilot**: Microsoft’s Responsible AI, cautious but practical (~5-10% refusals).
- **Why**: Ethics vary by cultural/legal context and corporate philosophy.

### XII. Other Relevant Factors: Scalability
- **Grok**: Cloud scales well for X users.
- **ChatGPT**: Highly scalable, enterprise-ready.
- **DeepSeek**: Local limited by hardware; cloud scales modestly.
