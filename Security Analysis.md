- Learn **Shellcode Injection, Process Hollowing, DLL Injection**.  
- Use **Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Empire, Sliver** for Red Team tactics.  
- Study **Bypassing AV/EDR** techniques (packing, encryption, obfuscation).  

### **11. Red Team vs Blue Team Simulations**  
- Understand **Red Team (offensive)** vs. **Blue Team (defensive)** methodologies.  
- Conduct **Purple Team exercises** for practical experience.  
- Use **MITRE CALDERA** for automated attack emulation.  

### **12. Cloud Security & DevSecOps**  
- Learn **AWS Security (IAM, KMS, Security Groups, GuardDuty)**.  
- Understand **Azure Security (Sentinel, Defender, Key Vault, RBAC)**.
